FunctionalTraining
==================

Introducing functional programming to interested and enlightened people.

## Running and compiling

In the root directory there is a shell script called `sbt`.  You can run it like so:

	./sbt

To run the program simply type `run` in the `sbt` console.

## Completing the exercises

I've kept this quite simple.  There are four packages, covering the areas we will be covering in this course.
Have fun.  Remember the types are the gateway to the solution.  Avoid mutability at all costs.
